Data augmentation using learned transformations for one-shot medical image segmentation

Traditional image segmentation rely on supervied training with lage labeled datasets. 
But labeling requires significant expertise and time.
The author present an automated data augmentation method for synthesizing labeled medical images.
Their merequires only a single segmented scan, and leverages other unlabeled scans in a semi-supervised approach.
